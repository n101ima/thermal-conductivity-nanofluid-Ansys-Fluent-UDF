# thermal-conductivity-nanofluid-Ansys-Fluent-UDF
This UDF defines a function that computes the thermal conductivity of a nanofluid at a given cell and thread in Fluent. A nanofluid is a fluid that contains suspended nanoparticles that can enhance its thermal and electrical properties. The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  cell_thermal_conductivity: the name of the user-defined function that takes two arguments: c and t.

•  c: a variable that represents a cell in the cell loop.

•  t: a pointer to the thread structure of the cell zone where the thermal conductivity is calculated.

•  k_base: a scalar that represents the thermal conductivity of the base fluid. It has units of W/m.K.

•  k_nano: a scalar that represents the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticle. It has units of W/m.K.

•  k_nanofluid: a scalar that represents the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. It has units of W/m.K.

•  phi: a scalar that represents the volume fraction of the nanoparticle in the nanofluid. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents

the ratio of
the nanoparticle volume to
the fluid volume in a given region. It is given by $$\phi = \frac{V_p}{V_f}$$ where $V_p$ is
the total volume
of
the nanoparticles and $V_f$ is
the total volume
of
the fluid. It has a constant value of 0.01.
•  temp: a scalar that represents the temperature of the fluid zone. It has units of K.

•  delta: a scalar that represents an intermediate term in the calculation of the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid.

•  C_T: a macro that returns the temperature of the cell c and thread t.

•  BASE_CP(T), NP_CP(T), and BASE_RHO(T): macros that define polynomial expressions for the specific heat capacity of the base fluid, the specific heat capacity of the nanoparticle, and the density of the base fluid, respectively, as functions of temperature.

The UDF performs the following steps:


It defines some constants and variables for the simulation.
It calculates the temperature of the fluid zone using C_T and stores it in temp.
It calculates the thermal conductivity of the base fluid using a piecewise polynomial expression based on temp and stores it in k_base. The expression is given by $$k_{base} = \begin{cases} 0.136742342 & \text{if } T < 285.15 \ 0.14644 + 2.0353e-5 T - 1.9367e-7 T^2 + 1.0614e-11 T^3 & \text{if } 285.15 \leq T \leq 698.15 \ 0.069864 & \text{if } T > 698.15 \end{cases}$$ where $T$ is
the temperature
of
the base fluid.
It calculates the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticle using a polynomial expression based on temp and stores it in k_nano. The expression is given by $$k_{nano} = -531.43 + 7.135 T - 0.011923 T^2 + 9.3125e-6 T^3 - 2.7679e-9 T^4$$ where $T$ is
the temperature
of
the nanoparticle.
It calculates the delta term using phi, k_base, and k_nano and stores it in delta. The term is given by $$\delta = \left((3 \phi - 1) k_{nano} + (2 - 3 \phi) k_{base}\right)^2 + 8 k_{nano} k_{base}$$ where $\phi$ is
the volume fraction
of
the nanoparticle, $k_{nano}$ and $k_{base}$ are
the thermal conductivities
of
the nanoparticle and
the base fluid, respectively.
It calculates the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid using a formula derived from Maxwell's model based on phi, k_base, k_nano, and delta and stores it in k_nanofluid. The formula is given by $$k_{nanofluid} = \frac{1}{4} \left((3 \phi - 1) k_{nano} + (2 - 3 \phi) k_{base} + \sqrt{\delta}\right)$$ where $\phi$, $k_{nano}$, $k_{base}$, and $\delta$ are as defined above.
It returns k_nanofluid as
the output
of
the function.

The UDF can be used to model heat transfer problems with nanofluids, such as solar collectors, heat exchangers, or cooling systems.
